# Selenium_Base_Element

This is the script that was created by following: Elegant Browser Automation with Python and Selenium

Legacy Note: I had to modify the instructions because: selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.element_to_be_clickable(mark) input parameter has changed from "locator" to "mark". Just removed "locator=" from line 26 on the Base_element.py file. This was changed in the newest revision of this file.
